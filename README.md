[![Moodle Plugin CI](https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_urcourses/workflows/Moodle%20Plugin%20CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_urcourses/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Moodle+Plugin+CI%22+branch%3Amain)

UR Courses is a boilerplate for enhancing Boost Union with custom or local functionality.


Motivation for this plugin
--------------------------

If you ever wanted to benefit from all the / only the Boost Union features you need, but you also had to realize additional local features or settings at the same time, do not look further: UR Courses is your friend.

With UR Courses, it is quite easy to create a grandchild theme of Boost Union. It will save you the time-consuming and headache-triggering first steps to create a grandchild theme, allowing you to start directly with the implementation of your local features.

But please note: While UR Courses will surely help you to realize all your local Boost Union dreams, please do yourself and the whole community a favour and verify that your planned features are indeed not interesting as a pull request or feature request for the whole Boost Union community and could be contributed to Boost Union directly instead.


Requirements
------------

UR Courses does not have a real requirement for a particular Boost Union or Moodle core release.

The code which you find in this repository is more or less release-agnostic. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the latest Boost Union release which goes with your Moodle core release.


Installation
------------

Install UR Courses like any other plugin to folder
/theme/urcourses

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins


Usage
-----

After installing UR Courses, it does not do anything to Moodle or Boost Union yet.

UR Courses integrates into the Boost Union settings as an additional settings page which you find on:
Site administration -> Appearance -> Boost Union -> UR Courses.

There, you find some settings:

### Settings page "UR Courses"

#### Tab "General settings"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### Pre SCSS inheritance

With this setting, you control if the pre SCSS code from Boost Union should be inherited or duplicated.

Most of the time, inheriting will be perfectly fine. However, it may happen that imperfect code is integrated into Boost Union which prevents simple SCSS inheritance for particular Boost Union features. If you encounter any issues with Boost Union features which seem not to work in UR Courses as well, try to switch this setting to 'Dupliate' and, if this solves the problem, report an issue on Github (see the 'Bug and problem reports' section below for details how to report an issue).

##### Extra SCSS inheritance

With this setting, you control if the extra SCSS code from Boost Union should be inherited or duplicated.

The reason behind this setting is the same as for the 'Pre SCSS inheritance' setting.


Building your local theme with this boilerplate
-----------------------------------------------

Even though UR Courses is a fully working theme, it looks and feels exactly the same as Boost Union itself (well, this is why we build UR Courses).

To build your own grandchild theme of Boost with this boilerplate, you have to go further.

### Renaming the grandchild theme (optional)

If you want to run your grandchild theme with a different name than theme_urcourses, for example theme_boost_union_foo, you have to take some actions:

* In the whole codebase of UR Courses below /theme/urcourses,
  * search all occurrences of 'urcourses' and replace them with 'boost_union_foo'
  * search all occurrences of 'UR Courses' and replace them with 'Boost Union Foo'
* In the language pack directory /theme/urcourses/lang,
  * rename the language pack file from en/theme_boost_union.php to en/theme_boost_foo.php
* In the tests directory /theme/urcourses/tests/behat,
  * rename the Behat step definition files from behat_theme_urcourses_behat_\*.php to behat_theme_boost_union_foo_behat_\*.php

### Add your UR Courses features

To add your local features to UR Courses, you can more or less follow all coding guidelines for Boost theme development which you find on the net. A good and official starting point is https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Themes.

To help you with the first steps, we have added some markers to UR Courses's codebase at the places where you can add your own features. Just search for EXTENSION POINT and you will find the places where you can add your settings, language strings, SCSS code and so on.

In addition to that, have a look at the 'Extension examples' section below.

### Finishing your grandchild theme (optional)

If you want to use Moodle plugin updates properly and especially if you intend to publish your grandchild theme, you set your plugin version information properly:

* In the version file /theme/urcourses/version.php,
  * raise $plugin->version to a proper version of your choice (see https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_versions for an explanation how Moodle version numbers are composed)
  * set $plugin->release to a release string of your choice (in Boost Union, we use release strings like 'v4.3-r1' which means 'First release for Moodle 4.3')
  * set $plugin->requires to the version number of the miniumum Moodle core version which you would like to support (see https://moodledev.io/general/releases for the list of Moodle core versions)
  * likewise, set $plugin->supported to an array with the range of Moodle core versions which you would like to support (for example, to support Moodle 4.3 only officially, set it to '[403, 403]')
  * raise the entry for theme_boost_union in $plugin->dependencies to the version number of the Boost Union version which you tested your grandchild theme against, just to avoid any hickups if someone tries to combine your grandchild theme with a much older version of Boost Union

As an orientation how all these settings should look like, you can compare /theme/urcourses/version.php with /theme/boost_union/version.php, of course.

### Congratulate yourself

Now your grandchild theme should be ready to be used in production. Well done!


Extension examples
------------------

### General

Developing for Boost Union means to apply similar techniques for every new feature. In this section, we try to collect some of these techniques for you.

### How to allow the admin to configure a SCSS variable with an admin setting

In the [extension-setting-scss-variable](https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_urcourses/tree/extension-setting-scss-variable) branch, we prepared some example code which shows you how allow the admin to configure a SCSS variable with an admin setting and without fiddling with SCSS.

In the example, we added a text admin setting into a dedicated admin settings tab. This setting is evaluated in lib.php where the pre-SCSS code is composed and where, based on the setting, a SCSS variable of Boost Core is overwritten. In this example, we chose to allow you to configure the $navbar-height variable. As a result, you can modify the height of the navbar just from within the admin setting if needed.

The example code is completed by a Behat test which verifies now and forever that the admin setting is doing its job properly.

### Modify a mustache template from Moodle core

In the [extension-modify-mustache-template](https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_urcourses/tree/extension-modify-mustache-template) branch, we prepared some example code which shows you how to modify a mustache template from Moodle core in UR Courses.

In the example, we copied the block.mustache template from Moodle core to UR Courses and modified in a way that the block controls are shown in the block footer now. The modified template will be used instantly as soon as UR Courses is the active theme.

Of course, the example code is completed by a Behat test which verifies now and forever that the modified template is used in UR Courses.

### Applying the example code branches

As the example code is provided in a simple git branch, you can just merge the code into the main branch if you like and continue from there:

```
git checkout main
git merge extension-setting-scss-variable
```

### Call for proposals

If you have another good extension example for UR Courses, we would be grateful if you would contribute it!

Just fork this repo, compose a branch with the extension example and create an issue in this repository to tell us the URL of your branch. We will then do our best to pick and publish your proposal.
